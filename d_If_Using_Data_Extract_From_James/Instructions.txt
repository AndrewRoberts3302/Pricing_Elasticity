In this folder you need a data extract from James Bennett, and call the file:

prices_table_to_use.csv

You need to open the file using Notepad++

The file will have pounds signs in and these need removing.

Go to "search" and select "Replace"

in the "Find what" section put a pound sign Â£, then click "Replace All"

This will remove all pound signs in the file.

Repeat the process for speech marks "

Then when you read in the csv file, be sure to set the encoding to latin-1:

dp = pd.read_csv("../b_Supplied_Data/prices_table_to_use.csv", parse_dates=["D_DateKey"], encoding='latin-1')
